## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the API up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.8** or newer installed.

### 2. Clone & Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd notes-api
```
Install the required Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install "fastapi[all]" uvicorn
```
3. Run the Server
Start the development server with Uvicorn. The --reload flag will automatically restart the server on code changes.
```bash

uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Future Work
This implementation uses a simple in-memory dictionary for data storage. This means all notes will be lost when the server restarts.

Potential future improvements include:

Database Integration: Connect to a persistent database like PostgreSQL or SQLite using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.

User Authentication: Implement OAuth2 to secure endpoints and manage user-specific notes.

Error Handling: Add more robust error handling for edge cases.

Containerization: Add a Dockerfile for easy deployment with Docker.
