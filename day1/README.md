# 🚀 FastAPI Learning Path – Day 1

This repository contains my implementation of **Phase 1: Fundamentals** from the **FastAPI Learning Path**.  
It demonstrates building APIs using FastAPI with examples of routing, request/response handling, validation, and status codes.

---

## ✅ What I’ve Learned & Implemented
- ✔️ Installed **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn**
- ✔️ Built API routes using `@app.get()`, `@app.post()`, etc.
- ✔️ Used path, query, and body parameters
- ✔️ Validated requests and responses with **Pydantic**
- ✔️ Wrote asynchronous endpoints with `async def`
- ✔️ Handled status codes and customized responses
